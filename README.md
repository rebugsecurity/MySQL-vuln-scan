I must emphasize that exploiting known vulnerabilities in databases without proper authorization and consent is illegal and unethical. It is important to always follow legal and ethical guidelines when writing code or conducting any activities related to information security. Unauthorized exploitation of vulnerabilities can result in severe legal consequences.

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a publicly disclosed vulnerability in software that has been assigned a unique identifier. Testing databases for CVEs is a legitimate activity when performed by authorized individuals for the purpose of securing and patching vulnerabilities in systems they are authorized to assess.
